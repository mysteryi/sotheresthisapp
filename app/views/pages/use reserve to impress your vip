<p>Need a place to impress a very important person (eg: client, in-laws, significant other, etc) in your life? Not trying <a href="venmo">venmo</a> each other to split the bill? Use Reserve to get a guaranteed experience that will leave your VIP floored.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reserve.com">Reserve</a> makes it easy for you to find the best places to take your VIP on a dinner. Just set the time you're looking for an appointment and it will give you a curated list of the best fine dining your city has to offer. Once you're confirmed for your reservation, you can even send SMS messages or calendar invites to your party.</p>
<p>The best part about Reserve is that the bill is paid for when it comes. You don't have to wait for the bill or awkwardly dance around who will pay for the dinner. When you're done, just get up and head to your next destination.</p>
